<h2>I.</h2>
<p>When we try to picture to ourselves the intellectual and moral state
of Europe in the Middle Ages, some fixed and almost stereotyped ideas
immediately suggest themselves. We think of the nations immersed in a
gross mental lethargy; passively witnessing the gradual extinction of
arts and sciences which Greece and Rome had splendidly inaugurated;
allowing libraries and monuments of antique civilisation to crumble
into dust; while they trembled under a dull and brooding terror of
coming judgment, shrank from natural enjoyment as from deadly sin, or
yielded themselves with brutal eagerness to the satisfaction of vulgar
appetites. Preoccupation with the other world in this long period
weakens man's hold upon the things that make his life desirable.
Philosophy is sunk in the slough of ignorant, perversely subtle
disputation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> upon subjects destitute of actuality. Theological
fanaticism has extinguished liberal studies and the gropings of the
reason after truth in positive experience. Society lies prostrate
under the heel of tyrannous orthodoxy. We discern men in masses,
aggregations, classes, guilds&mdash;everywhere the genus and the species of
humanity, rarely and by luminous exception individuals and persons.
Universal ideals of Church and Empire clog and confuse the nascent
nationalities. Prolonged habits, of extra-mundane contemplation,
combined with the decay of real knowledge, volatilise the thoughts and
aspirations of the best and wisest into dreamy unrealities, giving a
false air of mysticism to love, shrouding art in allegory, reducing
the interpretation of texts to an exercise of idle ingenuity, and the
study of Nature (in Bestiaries, Lapidaries, and the like) to an insane
system of grotesque and pious quibbling. The conception of man's fall
and of the incurable badness of this world bears poisonous fruit of
cynicism and asceticism, that twofold bitter almond, hidden in the
harsh monastic shell. The devil has become God upon this earth, and
God's eternal jailer in the next world. Nature is regarded with
suspicion and aversion; the flesh, with shame and loathing, broken by
spasmodic outbursts of lawless self-indulgence. For human life there
is one formula:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of what is't fools make such vain keeping?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sin their conception, their birth weeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their life a general mist of error,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their death a hideous storm of terror."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The contempt of the world is the chief theme of edification. A charnel
filled with festering corpses, snakes, and worms points the preacher's
moral. Before the eyes of all, in terror-stricken vision or in
nightmares of uneasy conscience, leap the inextinguishable flames of
hell. Salvation, meanwhile, is being sought through amulets, relics,
pilgrimages to holy places, fetishes of divers sorts and different
degrees of potency. The faculties of the heart and head, defrauded of
wholesome sustenance, have recourse to delirious debauches of the
fancy, dreams of magic, compacts with the evil one, insanities of
desire, ineptitudes of discipline. Sexual passion, ignoring the true
place of woman in society, treats her on the one hand like a servile
instrument, on the other exalts her to sainthood or execrates her as
the chief impediment to holiness. Common sense, sanity of judgment,
acceptance of things as they are, resolution to ameliorate the evils
and to utilise the goods of life, seem everywhere deficient. Men are
obstinate in misconception of their proper aims, wasting their
energies upon shadows instead of holding fast by realities, waiting
for a future whereof they know nothing, in lieu of mastering and
economising the present. The largest and most serious undertakings of
united Europe in this period&mdash;the Crusades&mdash;are based upon a radical
mistake. "Why seek ye the living among the dead? Behold, He is not
here, but risen!" With these words ringing in their ears, the nations
flock to Palestine and pour their blood forth for an empty sepulchre.
The one Emperor who attains the object of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> Christendom by rational
means is excommunicated for his success. Frederick II. returns from
the Holy Land a ruined man because he made a compact useful to his
Christian subjects with the Chief of Islam.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>II.</h2>


<p>Such are some of the stereotyped ideas which crowd our mind when we
reflect upon the Middle Ages. They are certainly one-sided. Drawn for
the most part from the study of monastic literature, exaggerated by
that reaction against medievalism which the Renaissance initiated,
they must be regarded as inadequate to represent the whole truth. At
no one period between the fall of the Roman Empire and the close of
the thirteenth century was the mental atmosphere of Europe so
unnaturally clouded. Yet there is sufficient substance in them to
justify their formulation. The earlier Middle Ages did, in fact,
extinguish antique civility. The later Middle Ages did create, to use
a phrase of Michelet, an army of dunces for the maintenance of
orthodoxy. The intellect and the conscience became used to moving
paralytically among visions, dreams, and mystic terrors, weighed down
with torpor, abusing virile faculties for the suppression of truth and
the perpetuation of revered error.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, with a sense of surprise, with something like a
shock to preconceived opinions, that we first become acquainted with
the medieval literature which it is my object in the present treatise
to make better known to English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> readers. That so bold, so fresh, so
natural, so pagan a view of human life as the Latin songs of the
Wandering Students exhibit, should have found clear and artistic
utterance in the epoch of the Crusades, is indeed enough to bid us
pause and reconsider the justice of our stereotyped ideas about that
period. This literature makes it manifest that the ineradicable
appetites and natural instincts of men and women were no less vigorous
in fact, though less articulate and self-assertive, than they had been
in the age of Greece and Rome, and than they afterwards displayed
themselves in what is known as the Renaissance.</p>

<p>With something of the same kind we have long been familiar in the
Troubadour poetry of Provence. But Proven&ccedil;al literature has a strong
chivalrous tincture, and every one is aware with what relentless fury
the civilisation which produced it was stamped out by the Church. The
literature of the Wandering Students, on the other hand, owes nothing
to chivalry, and emanates from a class which formed a subordinate part
of the ecclesiastical militia. It is almost vulgar in its presentment
of common human impulses; it bears the mark of the proletariate,
though adorned with flourishes betokening the neighbourhood of Church
and University.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>III.</h2>


<p>Much has recently been written upon the subject of an abortive
Renaissance within the Middle Ages. The centre of it was France, and
its period of brilliancy may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> be roughly defined as the middle and end
of the twelfth century. Much, again, has been said about the religious
movement in England, which spread to Eastern Europe, and anticipated
the Reformation by two centuries before the date of Luther. The songs
of the Wandering Students, composed for the most part in the twelfth
century, illustrate both of these early efforts after
self-emancipation. Uttering the unrestrained emotions of men attached
by a slender tie to the dominant clerical class and diffused over all
countries, they bring us face to face with a body of opinion which
finds in studied chronicle or laboured dissertation of the period no
echo. On the one side, they express that delight in life and physical
enjoyment which was a main characteristic of the Renaissance; on the
other, they proclaim that revolt against the corruption of Papal Rome
which was the motive-force of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of this poetry is derived from two chief sources. One is
a MS. of the thirteenth century, which was long preserved in the
monastery of Benedictbeuern in Upper Bavaria, and is now at Munich.
Richly illuminated with rare and curious illustrations of contemporary
manners, it seems to have been compiled for the use of some
ecclesiastical prince. This fine codex was edited in 1847 at
Stuttgart. The title of the publication is <i>Carmina Burana</i>, and under
that designation I shall refer to it. The other is a Harleian MS.,
written before 1264, which Mr. Thomas Wright collated with other
English MSS., and published in 1841 under the name of <i>Latin Poems
commonly attributed to Walter Mapes</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>These two sources have to some extent a common stock of poems, which
proves the wide diffusion of the songs in question before the date
assignable to the earlier of the two MS. authorities. But while this
is so, it must be observed that the <i>Carmina Burana</i> are richer in
compositions which form a prelude to the Renaissance; the English
collections, on the other hand, contain a larger number of serious and
satirical pieces anticipating the Reformation.</p>

<p>Another important set of documents for the study of the subject are
the three large works of Edelstand du M&eacute;ril upon popular Latin poetry;
while the stores at our disposal have been otherwise augmented by
occasional publications of German and English scholars, bringing to
light numerous scattered specimens of a like description. Of late it
has been the fashion in Germany to multiply anthologies of medieval
student-songs, intended for companion volumes to the <i>Commersbuch</i>.
Among these, one entitled <i>Gaudeamus</i> (Teubner, 2d edition, 1879)
deserves honourable mention.</p>

<p>It is my purpose to give a short account of what is known about the
authors of these verses, to analyse the general characteristics of
their art, and to illustrate the theme by copious translations. So far
as I am aware, the songs of Wandering Students offer almost absolutely
untrodden ground to the English translator; and this fact may be
pleaded in excuse for the large number which I have laid under
contribution.</p>

<p>In carrying out my plan, I shall confine myself princi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>pally, but not
strictly, to the <i>Carmina Burana</i>. I wish to keep in view the
anticipation of the Renaissance rather than to dwell upon those
elements which indicate an early desire for ecclesiastical reform.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>IV.</h2>


<p>We have reason to conjecture that the Romans, even during the
classical period of their literature, used accentual rhythms for
popular poetry, while quantitative metres formed upon Greek models
were the artificial modes employed by cultivated writers. However this
may be, there is no doubt that, together with the decline of antique
civilisation, accent and rhythm began to displace quantity and metre
in Latin versification. Quantitative measures, like the Sapphic and
Hexameter, were composed accentually. The services and music of the
Church introduced new systems of prosody. Rhymes, both single and
double, were added to the verse; and the extraordinary flexibility of
medieval Latin&mdash;that sonorous instrument of varied rhetoric used by
Augustine in the prose of the <i>Confessions</i>, and gifted with poetic
inspiration in such hymns as the <i>Dies Irae</i> or the <i>Stabat
Mater</i>&mdash;rendered this new vehicle of literary utterance adequate to
all the tasks imposed on it by piety and metaphysic. The language of
the <i>Confessions</i> and the <i>Dies Irae</i> is not, in fact, a decadent form
of Cicero's prose or Virgil's verse, but a development of the Roman
speech in accordance with the new conditions introduced by
Christianity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> It remained comparatively sterile in the department of
prose composition, but it attained to high qualities of art in the
verse and rhythms of men like Thomas of Celano, Thomas of Aquino, Adam
of St. Victor, Bernard of Morlais, and Bernard of Clairvaux. At the
same time, classical Latin literature continued to be languidly
studied in the cloisters and the schools of grammar. The metres of the
ancients were practised with uncouth and patient assiduity, strenuous
efforts being made to keep alive an art which was no longer rightly
understood. Rhyme invaded the hexameter, and the best verses of the
medieval period in that measure were leonine.</p>

<p>The hymns of the Church and the secular songs composed for music in
this base Latin took a great variety of rhythmic forms. It is clear
that vocal melody controlled their movement; and one fixed element in
all these compositions was rhyme&mdash;rhyme often intricate and complex
beyond hope of imitation in our language. Elision came to be
disregarded; and even the accentual values, which may at first have
formed a substitute for quantity, yielded to musical notation. The
epithet of popular belongs to these songs in a very real sense, since
they were intended for the people's use, and sprang from popular
emotion. Poems of this class were technically known as <i>moduli</i>&mdash;a
name which points significantly to the importance of music in their
structure. Imitations of Ovid's elegiacs or of Virgil's hexameters
obtained the name of <i>versus</i>. Thus Walter of Lille, the author of a
regular epic poem on Alexander, one of the best medieval writers of
<i>versus</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> celebrates his skill in the other department of popular
poetry thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Perstrepuit <i>modulis</i> Gallia tota meis."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(All France rang with my songs.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We might compare the <i>versus</i> of the Middle Ages with the stiff
sculptures on a Romanesque font, lifelessly reminiscent of decadent
classical art; while the <i>moduli</i>, in their freshness, elasticity, and
vigour of invention, resemble the floral scrolls, foliated cusps, and
grotesque basreliefs of Gothic or Lombard architecture.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>V.</h2>


<p>Even in the half-light of what used to be called emphatically the Dark
Ages, there pierce gleams which may be reflections from the past
evening of paganism, or may intimate the earliest dawn of modern
times. One of these is a song, partly popular, partly scholastic,
addressed to a beautiful boy.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It begins thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O admirabile veneris idolum"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and continues in this strain, upon the same rhythm, blending
reminiscences of classical mythology and medieval metaphysic, and
winding up with a reference to the Horatian <i>Vitas hinnuleo me similis
Chloe</i>. This poem was composed in the seventh century, probably at
Verona, for mention is made in it of the river Adige. The metre can
perhaps be regarded as a barbarous treatment of the long Asclepiad;
but each line seems to work out into <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>two bars, divided by a marked
rest, with two accents to each bar, and shows by what sort of
transition the modern French Alexandrine may have been developed.</p>

<p>The oddly archaic phraseology of this love-song rendered it unfit for
translation; but I have tried my hand at a kind of hymn in praise of
Rome, which is written in the same peculiar rhythm:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Rome illustrious, of the world emperess!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over all cities thou queen in thy goodliness!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red with the roseate blood of the martyrs, and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White with the lilies of virgins at God's right hand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome we sing to thee; ever we bring to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessings, and pay to thee praise for eternity.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Peter, thou praepotent warder of Paradise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear thou with mildness the prayer of thy votaries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou art seated to judge the twelve tribes, O then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show thyself merciful; be thou benign to men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when we call to thee now in the world's distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take thou our suffrages, master, with gentleness.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Paul, to our litanies lend an indulgent ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who the philosophers vanquished with zeal severe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou that art steward now in the Lord's heavenly house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give us to taste of the meat of grace bounteous;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that the wisdom which filled thee and nourished thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be our sustenance through the truths taught by thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A curious secular piece of the tenth century deserves more than
passing mention. It shows how wine, women, and song, even in an age
which is supposed to have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>trembled for the coming destruction of the
world, still formed the attraction of some natures. What is more,
there is a certain modern, as distinguished from classical, tone of
tenderness in the sentiment. It is the invitation of a young man to
his mistress, bidding her to a little supper in his rooms:<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come therefore now, my gentle fere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom as my heart I hold full dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enter my little room, which is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned with quaintest rarities:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are the seats with cushions spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roof with curtains overhead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house with flowers of sweetest scent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scattered herbs is redolent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A table there is deftly dight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With meats and drinks of rare delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There too the wine flows, sparkling, free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all, my love, to pleasure thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sound enchanting symphonies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clear high notes of flutes arise;<br /></span>

<p>From Du M&eacute;ril's collections further specimens of thoroughly secular

<p>Such are the sapphics on the spring, which, though they date from the

is the medieval legend of the Snow-Child, treated comically in

<h2>VI.</h2>


<p>There is little need to dwell upon these crepuscular stirrings of
popular Latin poetry in the earlier Middle Ages. To indicate their
existence was necessary; for they serve to link by a dim and fragile
thread of evolution the decadent art of the base Empire with the
renascence of paganism attempted in the twelfth century, and thus to
connect that dawn of modern feeling with the orient splendours of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Italy.</p>

<p>The first point to notice is the dominance of music in this verse, and
the subjugation of the classic metres to its influence. A deeply
significant transition has been effected from the <i>versus</i> to the
<i>modulus</i> by the substitution of accent for quantity, and by the value
given to purely <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>melodic cadences. A long syllable and a short
syllable have almost equal weight in this prosody, for the musical
tone can be prolonged or shortened upon either. So now the
<i>cantilena</i>, rather than the <i>metron</i>, rules the flow of verse; but,
at the same time, antique forms are still conventionally used, though
violated in the using. In other words, the modern metres of the modern
European races&mdash;the Italian Hendecasyllable, the French Alexandrine,
the English Iambic and Trochaic rhythms&mdash;have been indicated; and a
moment has been prepared when these measures shall tune themselves by
means of emphasis and accent to song, before they take their place as
literary schemes appealing to the ear in rhetoric. This phase, whereby
the metres of antiquity pass into the rhythms of the modern races,
implies the use of medieval Latin, still not unmindful of classic art,
but governed now by music often of Teutonic origin, and further
modified by affinities of prosody imported from Teutonic sources.</p>

<p>The next point to note is that, in this process of transition, popular
ecclesiastical poetry takes precedence of secular. The great rhyming
structures of the Middle Ages, which exercised so wide an influence
over early European literature, were invented for the service of the
Church&mdash;voluminous systems of recurrent double rhymes, intricate
rhythms moulded upon tunes for chanting, solid melodic fabrics, which,
having once been formed, were used for lighter efforts of the fancy,
or lent their ponderous effects to parody. Thus, in the first half of
the centuries which intervene between the extinction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> genuine
Roman Empire and the year 1300, ecclesiastical poetry took the lead in
creating and popularising new established types of verse, and in
rendering the spoken Latin pliable for various purposes of art.</p>

<p>A third point worthy of attention is, that a certain breath of
paganism, wafting perfumes from the old mythology, whispering of gods
in exile, encouraging men to accept their life on earth with genial
enjoyment, was never wholly absent during the darkest periods of the
Middle Ages. This inspiration uttered itself in Latin; for we have
little reason to believe that the modern languages had yet attained
plasticity enough for the expression of that specific note which
belongs to the Renaissance&mdash;the note of humanity conscious of its
Gr&aelig;co-Roman pagan past. This Latin, meanwhile, which it employed was
fabricated by the Church and used by men of learning.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VII.</h2>


<p>The songs of the Wandering Students were in a strict sense <i>moduli</i> as
distinguished from <i>versus</i>; popular and not scholastic. They were,
however, composed by men of culture, imbued with classical learning of
some sort, and prepared by scholarship for the deftest and most
delicate manipulation of the Latin language.</p>

<p>Who were these Wandering Students, so often mentioned, and of whom
nothing has been as yet related? As their name implies, they were men,
and for the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> part young men, travelling from university to
university in search of knowledge. Far from their homes, without
responsibilities, light of purse and light of heart, careless and
pleasure-seeking, they ran a free, disreputable course, frequenting
taverns at least as much as lecture-rooms, more capable of pronouncing
judgment upon wine or women than upon a problem of divinity or logic.
The conditions of medieval learning made it necessary to study
different sciences in different parts of Europe; and a fixed habit of
unrest, which seems to have pervaded society after the period of the
Crusades, encouraged vagabondage in all classes. The extent to which
travelling was carried in the Middle Ages for purposes of pilgrimage
and commerce, out of pure curiosity or love of knowledge, for the
bettering of trade in handicrafts or for self-improvement in the
sciences, has only of late years been estimated at a just calculation.
"The scholars," wrote a monk of Froidmont in the twelfth century, "are
wont to roam around the world and visit all its cities, till much
learning makes them mad; for in Paris they seek liberal arts, in
Orleans authors, at Salerno gallipots, at Toledo demons, and in no
place decent manners."</p>

<p>These pilgrims to the shrines of knowledge formed a class apart. They
were distinguished from the secular and religious clergy, inasmuch as
they had taken no orders, or only minor orders, held no benefice or
cure, and had entered into no conventual community. They were still
more sharply distinguished from the laity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> whom they scorned as
brutes, and with whom they seem to have lived on terms of mutual
hostility. One of these vagabond gownsmen would scarcely condescend to
drink with a townsman:<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>In a parody of the Mass, which is called <i>Officium Lusorum,</i> and in
which the prayers are offered to Bacchus, we find this devout
collect:<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;"Omnipotens sempiterne deus, qui inter rusticos et
clericos magnam discordiam seminasti, praesta quaesumus de laboribus
eorum vivere, de mulieribus ipsorum vero et de morte deciorum semper
gaudere."</p>

<p>The English version of this ribald prayer is even more explicit. It
runs thus:&mdash;"Deus qui multitudinem rusticorum ad servitium clericorum
venire fecisti et militum et inter nos et ipsos discordiam seminasti."</p>

<p>It is open to doubt whether the <i>milites</i> or soldiers were included
with the rustics in that laity, for which the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>students felt so bitter
a contempt. But the tenor of some poems on love, especially the
<i>Dispute of Phyllis and Flora</i>, shows that the student claimed a
certain superiority over the soldier. This antagonism between clerk
and rustic was heartily reciprocated. In a song on taverns the student
is warned that he may meet with rough treatment from the
clodhopper:<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>The affinities of the Wandering Students were rather with the Church
than with laymen of any degree. They piqued themselves upon their
title of <i>Clerici</i>, and added the epithet of <i>Vagi</i>. We shall see in
the sequel that they stood in a peculiar relation of dependence upon
ecclesiastical society.</p>

<p>According to tendencies prevalent in the Middle Ages, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>they became a
sort of guild, and proclaimed themselves with pride an Order. Nothing
is more clearly marked in their poetry than the <i>esprit de corps</i>,
which animates them with a cordial sense of brotherhood.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The same
tendencies which prompted their association required that they should
have a patron saint. But as the confraternity was anything but
religious, this saint, or rather this eponymous hero, had to be a
Rabelaisian character. He was called Golias, and his flock received
the generic name of Goliardi. Golias was father and master; the
Goliardi were his family, his sons, and pupils. <i>Familia Goliae</i>,
<i>Magister Golias</i>, <i>Pueri Goliae</i>, <i>Discipulus Goliae</i>, are phrases to
be culled from the rubrics of their literature.</p>

<p>Much has been conjectured regarding these names and titles. Was Golias
a real person? Did he give his own name to the Goliardi; or was he
invented after the Goliardi had already acquired their designation? In
either case, ought we to connect both words with the Latin <i>gula</i>, and
so regard the Goliardi as notable gluttons; or with the Proven&ccedil;al
<i>goliar</i>, <i>gualiar</i>, <i>gualiardor</i>, which carry a significance of
deceit? Had Golias anything to do with Goliath of the Bible, the great
Philistine, who in the present day would more properly be chosen as
the hero of those classes which the students held in horror?</p>

<p>It is not easy to answer these questions. All we know for certain is,
that the term Goliardus was in common medieval use, and was employed
as a synonym for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Wandering Scholar in ecclesiastical documents. <i>Vagi
scholares aut Goliardi&mdash;joculatores, goliardi seu bufones&mdash;goliardia
vel histrionatus&mdash;vagi scholares qui goliardi vel histriones alio
nomine appellantur&mdash;clerici ribaudi, maxime qui dicuntur de familia
Goliae</i>: so run the acts of several Church Councils.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The word
passed into modern languages. The <i>Grandes Chroniques de S. Denis</i>
speak of <i>jugleor, enchanteor, goliardois, et autres mani&egrave;res de
menestrieux</i>. Chaucer, in his description of the Miller, calls this
merry narrator of fabliaux <i>a jangler and a goliardeis</i>. In <i>Piers
Ploughman</i> the <i>goliardeis</i> is further explained to be <i>a glutton of
words</i>, and talks in Latin rhyme.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis, during whose lifetime the name Golias first came
into vogue, thought that this father of the Goliardic family was a
real person.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He writes of him thus:&mdash;"A certain parasite called
Golias, who in our time obtained wide notoriety for his gluttony and
lechery, and by addiction to gulosity and debauchery deserved his
surname, being of excellent culture but of bad manners, and of no
moral discipline, uttered oftentimes and in many forms, both of rhythm
and metre, infamous libels against the Pope and Curia of Rome, with no
less impudence than imprudence." This is perhaps the most outspoken
utterance with regard to the eponymous hero of the Goliardic class
which we possess, and it deserves a close inspection.</p>

<p>In the first place, Giraldus attributes the satiric poems <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>which
passed under the name of Golias to a single author famous in his days,
and says of this poet that he used both modern rhythms and classical
metres. The description would apply to Gualtherus de Insula, Walter of
Lille, or, as he is also called, Walter of Chatillon; for some of this
Walter's satires are composed in a curious mixture of the rhyming
measures of the medieval hymns with classical hexameters.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Yet had
Giraldus been pointing at Walter of Lille, a notable personage in his
times, there is no good reason to suppose that he would have
suppressed his real name, or have taken for granted that Golias was a
<i>bona fide</i> surname. On the theory that he knew Golias to be a mere
nickname, and was aware that Walter of Lille was the actual satirist,
we should have to explain his paragraph by the hypothesis that he
chose to sneer at him under his <i>nom de guerre</i> instead of
stigmatising him openly in person.</p>

<p>His remarks, at any rate, go far toward disposing of the old belief
that the Goliardic satires were the work of Thomas Mapes. Giraldus was
an intimate friend of that worthy, who deserves well of all lovers of
medieval romance as a principal contributor to the Arthurian cycle. It
is hardly possible that Giraldus should have gibbeted such a man under
the sobriquet of Golias.</p>

<p>But what, it may be asked, if Walter of Lille, without <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>the cognisance
of our English annalist, had in France obtained the chief fame of
these poems? what if they afterwards were attributed in England to
another Walter, his contemporary, himself a satirist of the monastic
orders? The fact that Walter of Lille was known in Latin as Gualtherus
de Insula, or Walter of the Island, may have confirmed the
misapprehension thus suggested. It should be added that the ascription
of the Goliardic satires to Walter Mapes or Map first occurs in MSS.
of the fourteenth century.</p>

<h2>VIII.</h2>


<p>I do not think there is much probability of arriving at certainty with
regard to the problems indicated in the foregoing section. We must be
content to accept the names Golias and Goliardi as we find them, and
to treat of this literature as the product of a class, from the midst
of which, as it is clear to any critic, more than one poet rose to
eminence.</p>

<p>One thing appears manifest from the references to the Goliardi which I
have already quoted. That is, that the Wandering Students ranked in
common estimation with jongleurs, buffoons, and minstrels. Both
classes held a similar place in medieval society. Both were parasites
devoted to the entertainment of their superiors in rank. Both were
unattached, except by occasional engagements, to any fixed abode. But
while the minstrels found their temporary homes in the castles of the
nobility, we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> reason to believe that the Goliardi haunted abbeys
and amused the leisure of ecclesiastical lords.</p>

<p>The personality of the writer disappears in nearly all the <i>Carmina
Vagorum</i>. Instead of a poet with a name, we find a type; and the verse
is put into the mouth of Golias himself, or the Archipoeta, or the
Primate of the order. This merging of the individual in the class of
which he forms a part is eminently characteristic of popular
literature, and separates the Goliardic songs from those of the
Proven&ccedil;al Troubadours. The emotions to which popular poetry gives
expression are generic rather than personal. They are such that all
the world, granted common sympathies and common proclivities, can feel
them and adopt the mode of utterance invented for them by the singer.
If there be any bar to their universal acceptance, it is only such as
may belong to the peculiar conditions of the social class from which
they have emanated. The <i>Rispetti</i> of Tuscany imply a certain form of
peasant life. The <i>Carmina Vagorum</i> are coloured to some extent by the
prejudices and proclivities of vagabond existence.</p>

<p>Trenchantly true as the inspiration of a popular lyric may be,
inevitable as may be the justice of its sentiment, unerring as may be
its touch upon reality, still it lacks the note which marks it out for
one man's utterance among a thousand. Composing it, the one has made
himself the mouthpiece of the thousand. What the <i>Volkslied</i> gains in
universality it loses in individuality of character. Its applicability
to human nature at large is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> obtained at the sacrifice of that
interest which belongs to special circumstances. It suits every one
who grieves or loves or triumphs. It does not indicate the love, the
grief, the triumph of this man and no other. It possesses the pathos
and the beauty of countless human lives prolonged through inarticulate
generations, finding utterance at last in it. It is deficient in that
particular intonation which makes a Shelley's voice differ from a
Leopardi's, Petrarch's sonnets for Laura differ from Sidney's sonnets
for Stella. It has always less of perceptible artistic effect, more
enduring human quality. Some few of its lines are so well found, so
rightly said, that they possess the certainty of natural things&mdash;a
quality rare in the works of all but the greatest known poets. But
these phrases with the accent of truest truth are often embedded in
mere generalities and repetitions.</p>

<p>These characteristics of popular poetry help to explain the frequent
recurrence of the same ideas, the same expressions, the same stanzas
even, in the lyrics of the Goliardi. A <i>Volkslied</i>, once created,
becomes common property. It flies abroad like thistledown; settles and
sows its seed; is maimed and mutilated; is improved or altered for the
worse; is curtailed, expanded, adapted to divers purposes at different
times and in very different relations.</p>

<p>We may dismiss the problem of authorship partly as insoluble, partly
as of slight importance for a literature which is manifestly popular.
With even greater brevity may the problem of nationality be disposed
of. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> critics have claimed an Italian, some an English, some a
French, and some a German origin for the <i>Carmina Vagorum</i>. The truth
is that, just as the <i>Clerici Vagi</i> were themselves of all nations, so
were their songs; and the use of a Latin common to all Europe in the
Middle Ages renders it difficult even to conjecture the soil from
which any particular lyric may have sprung. As is natural, a German
codex contains more songs of Teutonic origin; an English displays
greater abundance of English compositions. I have already observed
that our two chief sources of Goliardic literature have many elements
in common; but the treasures of the Benedictbeuern MS. differ in
complexion from those of the Harleian in important minor details; and
it is probable that if French and Italian stores were properly
ransacked&mdash;which has not yet been done&mdash;we should note in them similar
characteristic divergences.</p>

<p>The <i>Carmina Burana</i>, by their frequent references to linden-trees and
nightingales, and their numerous German refrains, indicate a German
home for the poems on spring and love, in which they are specially
rich.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The collections of our own land have an English turn of
political thought; the names Anglia and Anglus not unfrequently occur;
and the use of the word "Schellinck" in one of the <i>Carmina Burana</i>
may point, perhaps, to an <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>English origin. France claims her own, not
only in the acknowledged pieces of Walter de Lille, but also in a few
which exhibit old French refrains. To Italian conditions, if not to
Italian poets, we may refer those that introduce spreading pines or
olive-trees into their pictures, and one which yields the refrain
<i>Bela mia</i>. The most important lyric of the series, <i>Golias'
Confession</i>, was undoubtedly written at Pavia, but whether by an
Italian or not we do not know. The probability is rather, perhaps, in
favour of Teutonic authorship, since this <i>Confession</i> is addressed to
a German prelate. Here it may be noticed that the proper names of
places and people are frequently altered to suit different countries;
while in some cases they are indicated by an N, sufficiently
suggestive of their generality. Thus the <i>Confession of Golias</i> in the
<i>Carmina Burana</i> mentions <i>Electe Coloniae</i>; in an English version,
introduces <i>Praesul Coventriae</i>. The prayer for alms, which I have
translated in Section xiii., is addressed to <i>Decus N&mdash;&mdash;</i>, thou
honour of Norwich town, or Wittenberg, or wherever the wandering
scholar may have chanced to be.</p>

<p>With regard to the form and diction of the <i>Carmina Vagorum</i>, it is
enough to say two things at the present time. First, a large portion
of these pieces, including a majority of the satires and longer
descriptive poems, are composed in measures borrowed from hymnology,
follow the diction of the Church, and imitate the double-rhyming
rhythms of her sequences. It is not unnatural, this being the case,
that parodies of hymns should be comparatively common.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> Of these I
shall produce some specimens in the course of this study. Secondly,
those which do not exhibit popular hymn measures are clearly written
for melodies, some of them very complicated in structure, suggesting
part-songs and madrigals, with curious interlacing of long and short
lines, double and single rhymes, recurrent ritournelles, and so forth.</p>

<p>The ingenuity with which these poets adapted their language to the
exigencies of the tune, taxing the fertility of Latin rhymes, and
setting off the long sonorous words to great advantage, deserves
admiring comment. At their best, it is almost impossible to reproduce
in English the peculiar effects of their melodic artifices. But there
is another side to the matter. At their worst, these Latin lyrics,
moulded on a tune, degenerate into disjointed verbiage, sound and
adaptation to song prevailing over sense and satisfaction to the mind.
It must, however, be remembered that such lyrics, sometimes now almost
unintelligible, have come down to us with a very mutilated text, after
suffering the degradations through frequent oral transmission to which
popular poetry is peculiarly liable.</p>

<h2>IX.</h2>


<p>It is easier to say what the Goliardi wrote about than who the writers
were, and what they felt and thought than by what names they were
baptised. The mass of their literature, as it is at present known to
us, divides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> into two broad classes. The one division includes poems
on the themes of vagabond existence, the truant life of these
capricious students; on spring-time and its rural pleasure; on love in
many phases and for divers kinds of women; lastly, on wine and on the
dice-box. The other division is devoted to graver topics; to satires
on society, touching especially the Roman Court, and criticising
eminent ecclesiastics in all countries; to moral dissertations, and to
discourses on the brevity of life.</p>

<p>Of the two divisions, the former yields by far the livelier image of
the men we have to deal with. It will therefore form the staple of my
argument. The latter blends at so many points with medieval literature
of the monastic kind, that it is chiefly distinguished by boldness of
censure and sincerity of invective. In these qualities the serious
poems of the Goliardi, emanating from a class of men who moved behind
the scenes and yet were free to speak their thoughts, are unique.
Written with the satirist's eye upon the object of his sarcasm, tinged
with the license of his vagabondage, throbbing with the passionate and
nonchalant afflatus of the wine-cup, they wing their flight like
poisoned arrows or plumed serpents with unerring straightness at
abuses in high places.</p>

<p>The wide space occupied by Nature in the secular poems of the Goliardi
is remarkable. As a background to their love-songs we always find the
woods and fields of May, abundant flowers and gushing rivulets,
lime-trees and pines and olive-trees, through which soft winds are
blowing. There are rose-bowers and nightingales; fauns,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> nymphs, and
satyrs dancing on the sward. Choirs of mortal maidens emerge in the
midst of this Claude-landscape. The scene, meanwhile, has been painted
from experience, and felt with the enthusiasm of affection. It
breathes of healthy open air, of life upon the road, of casual joys
and wayside pleasure, snatched with careless heart by men whose tastes
are natural. There is very little of the alcove or the closet in this
verse; and the touch upon the world is so infantine, so tender, that
we are indulgent to the generalities with which the poets deal.</p>

<p>What has been said about popular poetry applies also to popular
painting. In the landscapes of Goliardic literature there is nothing
specific to a single locality&mdash;no name like Vaucluse, no pregnant
touch that indicates one scene selected from a thousand. The landscape
is always a background, more northern or more southern as the case may
be, but penetrated with the feeling of the man who has been happy or
has suffered there. This feeling, broadly, sensuously diffused, as in
a masterpiece of Titian, prepares us for the human element to be
exhibited.</p>

<p>The foreground of these pictures is occupied by a pair of lovers
meeting after the long winter's separation, a dance upon the village
green, a young man gazing on the mistress he adores, a disconsolate
exile from his home, the courtship of a student and a rustic beauty,
or perhaps the grieved and melancholy figure of one whose sweetheart
has proved faithless. Such actors in the comedy of life are defined
with fervent intensity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> touch against the leafy vistas of the
scene. The lyrical cry emerges clear and sharp in all that concerns
their humanity.</p>

<p>The quality of love expressed is far from being either platonic or
chivalrous. It is love of the sensuous, impulsive, appetitive kind, to
which we give the name of Pagan. The finest outbursts of passion are
emanations from a potent sexual desire. Meanwhile, nothing indicates
the character or moral quality of either man or woman. The student and
the girl are always <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, fixed characters in this lyrical
love-drama. He calls her Phyllis, Flora, Lydia, Glycerion, Caecilia.
He remains unnamed, his physical emotion sufficing for personal
description. The divinity presiding over them is Venus. Jove and
Danae, Cupid and the Graces, Paris and Helen, follow in her train. All
the current classical mythology is laid under cheap contribution. Yet
the central emotion, the young man's heart's desire, is so vividly
portrayed, that we seem to be overhearing the triumphant ebullition or
the melancholy love-lament of a real soul.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>X.</h2>


<p>The sentiment of love is so important in the songs of the Wandering
Students, that it may not be superfluous at this point to cull a few
emphatic phrases which illustrate the core of their emotion, and to
present these in the original Latin.</p>

<p>I may first observe to what a large extent the ideas of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> spring and of
female society were connected at that epoch. Winter was a dreary
period, during which a man bore his fate and suffered. He emerged from
it into sunshine, brightened by the intercourse with women, which was
then made possible. This is how the winter is described:<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In omni loco congruo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sermonis oblectatio<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cum sexu femineo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Evanuit omni modo."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of the true love-songs, only one refers expressly to the winter
season. That, however, is the lyric upon Flora, which contains a
detailed study of plastic form in the bold spirit of the Goliardic
style.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The particularity with which the personal charms of women are
described deserves attention. The portrait of Flora, to which I have
just alluded, might be cited as one of the best specimens. But the
slightest shades are discriminated, as in this touch:<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Labellulis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Castigate tumentibus."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One girl has long tawny tresses: <i>Caesaries subrubea</i>. Another is
praised for the masses of her dark hair: <i>Frons nimirum coronata,
supercilium nigrata</i>. Roses and lilies vie, of course, upon the cheeks
of all; and sometimes their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>sweetness surpasses the lily of the
valley. From time to time a touch of truer poetry occurs; as, for
instance<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O decora super ora<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belli Absalonis!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or take again the outburst of passion in this stanza, where both the
rhythm and the ponderous Latin words, together with the abrupt
transition from the third to the fourth line, express a fine
exaltation:<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Frons et gula, labra, mentum<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Crines ejus adamavi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoniam fuere flavi."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same kind of enthusiasm is more elaborately worked out in the
following comparisons:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Matutini sideris<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Per labium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ut Sirium<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Credat quis enitere."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As might be expected, such lovers were not satisfied with
contemplative pleasures:<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Visu, colloquio,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Linea posterior<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et melior amori,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The conclusion of this song, which, taken in its integrity, deserves
to be regarded as typical of what is pagan in this erotic literature,
may be studied in the Appendix to <i>Carmina Burana</i>.</p>

<p>Occasionally the lover's desire touches a higher point of
spirituality:<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Non tactu sanabor labiorum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nisi cor unum fiat duorum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et idem velle. Vale, flos florum!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Occasionally, the sensuous fervour assumes a passionate
intensity:<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nocte cum ea si dormiero,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si sua labra semel suxero,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mortem subire, placenter obire, vitamque finire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Libens potero."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Very rarely there is a strong desire expressed for fidelity, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>as in a
beautiful lyric of absence, which I hope to give translated in full in
my 17th Section.</p>

<p>But the end to be attained is always such as is summed up in these
brief words placed upon a girl's lips:<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dulcissime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Totam tibi subdo me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the motto of both sexes is this:<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quicquid agant alii,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Juvenes amemus."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It may be added, in conclusion, that the sweethearts of our students
seem to have been mostly girls of the working and rustic classes,
sometimes women of bad fame, rarely married women. In no case that has
come beneath my notice is there any hint that one of them aspired to
such amours with noble ladies as distinguished the Troubadours. A
democratic tone, a tone of the proletariate, is rather strangely blent
with the display of learning, and with the more than common literary
skill apparent in their work.</p>

<h2>XI.</h2>


<p>The drinking-songs are equally spontaneous and fresh. Anacreon pales
before the brilliancy of the Archipoeta when wine is in his veins, and
the fountain of the Bacchic chant swells with gushes of strongly
emphasised bold <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>double rhymes, each throbbing like a man's firm
stroke upon the strings of lyres. A fine audacity breathes through the
praises of the wine-god, sometimes rising to lyric rapture, sometimes
sinking to parody and innuendo, but always carrying the bard on
rolling wheels along the paths of song. The reality of the inspiration
is indubitable. These Bacchanalian choruses have been indited in the
tavern, with a crowd of topers round the poet, with the rattle of the
dice-box ringing in his ears, and with the facile maidens of his
volatile amours draining the wine-cup at his elbow.</p>

<p>Wine is celebrated as the source of pleasure in social life,
provocative of love, parent of poetry:<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>As in the love-songs, so in these drinking-songs we find no lack of
mythological allusions. Nor are the grammatical quibbles, which might
also have been indicated as a defect of the erotic poetry, conspicuous
by absence. But both alike are impotent to break the spell of evident
sincerity. We discount them as belonging to the euphuism of a certain
epoch, and are rather surprised than otherwise that they should not be
more apparent. The real and serious defect of Goliardic literature is
not affectation, but something very different, which I shall try to
indicate in the last Section of this treatise. Venus and Helen, Liber
and Lyaeus, are but the current coin of poetic diction common to the
whole student class. These Olympian deities merge without a note of
discord into the dim background of a medieval pothouse or the sylvan
shades of some ephemeral amour, leaving the realism of natural
appetite in either case untouched.</p>

<p>It is by no means the thin and conventional sprinkling of classical
erudition which makes these poems of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Goliardi pagan, and reminds
the student of Renaissance art. Conversely, the scholastic plays on
words which they contain do not stamp them out as medieval. Both of
these qualities are <i>rococo</i> and superficial rather than essential and
distinctive in their style. After making due allowances for either
element of oddity, a true connoisseur will gratefully appreciate the
spontaneous note of enjoyment, the disengagement from ties and duties
imposed by temporal respectability, the frank animalism, which
connects these vivid hymns to Bacchus and Venus with past Aristophanes
and future Rabelais. They celebrate the eternal presence of
mirth-making powers in hearts of men, apart from time and place and
varying dogmas which do not concern deities of Nature.</p>

<h2>XII.</h2>


<p>The time has now come for me to introduce my reader to the versions I
have made from the songs of Wandering Students. I must remind him
that, while the majority of these translations aim at literal
exactness and close imitation of the originals in rhyme and structure,
others are more paraphrastic. It has always been my creed that a good
translation should resemble a plaster-cast; the English being <i>plaqu&egrave;</i>
upon the original, so as to reproduce its exact form, although it
cannot convey the effects of bronze or marble, which belong to the
material of the work of art. But this method has not always seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
me the most desirable for rendering poems, an eminent quality of which
is facility and spontaneity. In order to obtain that quality in our
language, the form has occasionally to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>What Coleridge has reported to have said of Southey may be applied to
a translator. He too "is in some sort like an elegant setter of
jewels; the stones are not his own: he gives them all the advantage of
his art, but not their native brilliancy." I feel even more than this
when I attempt translation, and reflect that, unlike the jeweller, it
is my doom to reduce the lustre of the gems I handle, even if I do not
substitute paste and pebbles. Yet I am frequently enticed to repeat
experiments, which afterwards I regard in the light of failures. What
allures me first is the pleasure of passing into that intimate
familiarity with art which only a copyist or a translator enjoys. I am
next impelled by the desire to fix the attention of readers on things
which I admire, and which are possibly beyond their scope of view.
Lastly comes that <i>ignis fatuus</i> of the hope, for ever renewed, if
also for ever disappointed, that some addition may be made in this way
to the wealth of English poetry. A few exquisite pieces in Latin
literature, the Catullian <i>Ille mi par</i>, for example, a few in our
own, such as Jonson's <i>Drink to me only with thine eyes</i>, are
translations. Possibly the miracle of such poetic transmutation may be
repeated for me; possibly an English song may come to birth by my
means also. With this hope in view, the translator is strongly tempted
to engraft upon his versions elegances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> in the spirit of his native
language, or to use the motives of the original for improvisations in
his own manner. I must plead guilty to having here and there yielded
to this temptation, as may appear upon comparison of my English with
the Latin. All translation is a compromise; and while being conscious
of having to sacrifice much, the translator finds himself often
seeking to add something as a makeweight.</p>

<p>I shall divide my specimens into nine Sections. The first will include
those which deal with the Order of Wandering Students in general,
winding up with the <i>Confession</i> ascribed to Golias, the father of the
family. The second, third, fourth, and fifth are closely connected,
since they contain spring-songs, pastorals, descriptive poems touching
upon love, and erotic lyrics. The sixth Section will be devoted to a
few songs of exile, doubt, and sorrow. In the seventh we shall reach
anacreontics on the theme of wine, passing in the eighth to parodies
and comic pieces. Four or five serious compositions will close the
list in the ninth Section.</p>

<p>At the end of the book I mean to print a table containing detailed
references to the originals of the songs I have chosen for
translation, together with an index of the principal works that have
been published on this subject.</p>

<h2>XIII.</h2>


<p>The first song which concerns the Order of Wandering Students in
general has been attributed to the Archipoeta or head-bard of the
guild. Whoever this poet may have been, it is to him that we owe the
<i>Confession of Golias</i>, by far the most spirited composition of the
whole Goliardic species. I do not think the style of the poem on the
Order, though it belongs to a good period, justifies our ascribing it
to so inspired and genial a lyrist.</p>

<p>The argument runs as follows. Just as commission was given to the
Apostles to go forth and preach in the whole world, so have the
Wandering Students a vocation to travel, and to test the hearts of men
wherever they may sojourn. A burlesque turn is given to this function
of the <i>Vagi</i>. Yet their consciousness of a satiric mission, their
willingness to pose as critics of society from the independent
vantage-ground of vagabondage, seems seriously hinted at.</p>

<p>The chief part of the song is devoted to a description of the
comprehensive nature of the Order, which receives all sorts and
conditions of men, and makes no distinction of nationality. The
habitual poverty of its members, their favourite pastimes and vices,
their love of gaming and hatred of early rising, are set forth with
some humour.</p>

<p>The next song is a lament for the decay of the Order and the
suppression of its privileges. It was written, to all appearances, at
a later date, and is inferior in style. The Goliardi had already, we
learn from it, exchanged poverty for luxury. Instead of tramping on
the hard hoof, they moved with a retinue of mounted servants. We seem
to trace in the lament a change from habits of simple vagabondage to
professional dependence, as minstrels and secretaries, upon men of
rank in Church and State, which came over the Goliardic class. This
poem, it may be mentioned, does not occur in the <i>Carmina Burana</i>, nor
is it included among those which bear the name of Walter Mapes or Map.</p>

<p>Next in order to these poems, which display the Wandering Students as
a class, I will produce two that exhibit their mode of life in detail.
The first is a begging petition, addressed by a scholar on the tramp
to the great man of the place where he is staying. The name of the
place, as I have already noticed, is only indicated by an N. The nasal
whine of a suppliant for alms, begging, as Erasmus begged, not in the
name of charity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> but of learning, makes itself heard both in the
rhyme and rhythm of the original Latin. I have tried to follow the
sing-song doggerel.</p>

<p>The second is a jovial <i>Song of the Open Road</i>, throbbing with the
exhilaration of young life and madcap impudence. We must imagine that
two vagabond students are drinking together before they part upon
their several ways. One addresses the other as <i>frater catholice, vir
apostolice</i>, vows to befriend him, and expounds the laws of loyalty
which bind the brotherhood together. To the rest of the world they are
a terror and a nuisance. Honest folk are jeeringly forbidden to beware
of the <i>quadrivium</i>, which is apt to form a fourfold rogue instead of
a scholar in four branches of knowledge.</p>

<p>The Latin metre is so light, careless, and airy, that I must admit an
almost complete failure to do it justice in my English version. The
refrain appears intended to imitate a bugle-call.</p>

<p>In the fourth place I insert the <i>Confession of Golias</i>. This
important composition lays bare the inner nature of a Wandering
Student, describing his vagrant habits, his volatile and
indiscriminate amours, his passion for the dice-box, his devotion to
wine, and the poetic inspiration he was wont to draw from it.</p>

<p>In England this <i>Confession</i> was attributed to Walter Map; and the
famous drinking-song, on which the Archdeacon of Oxford's reputation
principally rests in modern times, was extracted from the stanzas II
<i>et seq.</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> But, though Wright is unwilling to refuse Map such
honour as may accrue to his fame from the composition, we have little
reason to regard it as his work. The song was clearly written at
Pavia&mdash;a point inexplicably overlooked by Wright in the note appended
to stanza 9&mdash;and the Archbishop-elect of Cologne, who is appealed to
by name in stanza 24, was Reinald von Dassel, a minister of Frederick
Barbarossa. This circumstance enables us to determine the date of the
poem between 1162 and 1165. When the <i>Confession</i> was manipulated for
English readers, <i>Praesul Coventrensium, Praesul mibi cognite</i>, and <i>O

left standing&mdash;a sufficient indication of literary rehandling by a
clumsy scribe. In the text of the <i>Carmina Burana</i>, the <i>Confession</i>
winds up with a petition that Reinald von Dassel should employ the
poet as a secretary, or should bestow some mark of his bounty upon
him.</p>

<h2>XIV.</h2>

<p>Having been introduced to the worshipful order of vagrants both in
their collective and in their personal capacity, we will now follow
them to the woods and fields in spring. It was here that they sought
love-adventures and took pastime after the restraints of winter.</p>

<p>The spring-songs are all, in the truest sense of the word,
<i>lieder</i>&mdash;lyrics for music. Their affinities of form and rhythm are
less with ecclesiastical verse than with the poetry of the Minnesinger
and the Troubadour. Sometimes we are reminded of the French
<i>pastourelle</i>, sometimes of the rustic ditty, with its monotonous
refrain.</p>

<p>The exhilaration of the season which they breathe has something of the
freshness of a lark's song, something at times of the richness of the
nightingale's lament. The defect of the species may be indicated in a
single phrase. It is a tedious reiteration of commonplaces in the
opening stanzas. Here, however, is a lark-song.</p>

<p>Occasionally his passion assumes a romantic tone, as is the case with
the following <i>Serenade</i> to a girl called Flos-de-spina in the Latin.
Whether that was her real name, or was only used for poetical
purposes, does not admit of debate now. Anyhow, Flos-de-spina,
Fior-di-spina, Fleur-d'epine, and English Flower-o'-the-thorn are all
of them pretty names for a girl.</p>

here unusual depth, a strain of <i>sehnsucht</i>; and the picture of the
mother followed by her daughter in the country-dance suggests the
domesticity of Northern races.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>But the theme of the dance is worked up with even greater elaboration
and a more studied ingenuity of rhyme and rhythm in the following
characteristic song. This has the true accent of what may be called
the <i>Musa Vagabundula</i>, and is one of the best lyrics of the
series:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<h2>XV.</h2>


<p>A separate Section can be devoted to songs in the manner of the early
French pastoral. These were fashionable at a remote period in all
parts of Europe; and I have already had occasion, in another piece of
literary history, to call attention to the Italian madrigals of the
fourteenth century composed in this species.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Their point is mainly
this: A man of birth and education, generally a dweller in the town,
goes abroad into the fields, lured by fair spring weather, and makes
love among trees to a country wench.</p>

<p>The <i>Vagi</i> turn the pastoral to their own purpose, and always
represent the greenwood lover as a <i>clericus</i>. One of these rural
nieces has a pretty opening stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When the sweet Spring was ascending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet May, at April's ending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the sun was heavenward wending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood a girl of grace transcending<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Underneath the green bough, sending<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Songs aloft with pipings."<br />

<p>A fourth, consisting of a short conventional introduction in praise of

species.</p>

<h2>XVI.</h2>


<p>Some semi-descriptive pieces, which connect the songs of Spring with
lyrics of a more purely personal emotion, can boast of rare beauty in
the original.</p>

<p>The most striking of these, upon the theme of Sleep and Love, I have
tried to render in trochaic verse, feeling it impossible, without
knowledge of the medieval melody, to reproduce its complicated and now
only half-intelligible rhythms.</p>

<p>The most highly wrought of descriptive poems in this species is the
<i>Dispute of Flora and Phyllis</i>, which occurs both in the <i>Carmina
Burana</i> and in the English MSS.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> edited by Wright. The motive of the
composition is as follows:&mdash;Two girls wake in the early morning, and
go out to walk together through the fields. Each of them is in love;
but Phyllis loves a soldier, Flora loves a scholar. They interchange
confidences, the one contending with the other for the superiority of
her own sweetheart.</p>

<p>Having said so much, I will present the first part of the poem in the
English version I have made.</p>

<p>Phyllis thus opens the question whether a soldier or a scholar be the
fitter for love. Flora responds, and for some time they conduct the
dispute in true scholastic fashion. Being unable to settle it between
themselves, they resolve to seek out Love himself, and to refer the
matter to his judgment. One girl mounts a mule, the other a horse; and
these are no ordinary animals, for Neptune reared one beast as a
present to Venus, Vulcan forged the metal-work of bit and saddle,
Minerva embroidered the trappings, and so forth. After a short journey
they reach the Garden of Love, which is described with a truly
luxuriant wealth of imagery. It resembles some of the earlier
Renaissance pictures, especially one of great excellence by a German
artist which I once saw in a dealer's shop at Venice, and which ought
now to grace a public gallery.</p>

<p>It would surely be superfluous to point out the fluent elegance of
this poem, or to dwell farther upon the astonishing fact that anything
so purely Renaissance in tone should have been produced in the twelfth
century.</p>

<p>Cupid, as was natural, settles the dispute of the two girls by
deciding that scholars are more suitable for love than soldiers.</p>

<p>This would be the place to introduce another long descriptive poem, if
the nature of its theme rendered it fit for translation. It relates
the visit of a student to what he calls the <i>Templum Veneris</i>; in
other words, to the house of a courtesan. Her attendants are sirens;
and the whole poem, dealing with a vulgar incident, is conducted in
this mock-heroic strain.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>We pass now to love-poems of a more purely personal kind. One of
these, which is too long for translation and in some respects
ill-suited to a modern taste, forms the proper transition from the
descriptive to the lyrical section. It starts with phrases culled from
hymns to the Virgin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Si linguis angelicis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loquar et humanis."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ave formosissima,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gemma pretiosa;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ave decus virginum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virgo gloriosa!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These waifs and strays of religious diction are curiously blent with
romantic and classical allusions. The girl is addressed in the same
breath as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Blanziflor et Helena,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venus generosa."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Toward the close of the poem, the lover, who at length has reached the
object of his heart's desire, breaks into this paean of victorious
passion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What more? Around the maiden's neck<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My arms I flung with yearning;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her lips I gave and took<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A thousand kisses burning:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span><span class="i0">Again and yet again I cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With whispered vows and sighing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, this alone, sure, sure it was<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For which my heart was dying!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who is the man that does not know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sweets that followed after?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My former pains, my sobs and woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were changed for love and laughter:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joys of Paradise were ours<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In overflowing measure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We tasted every shape of bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And every form of pleasure."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next piece which I shall quote differs in some important respects
from the general style adopted by the Goliardi in their love-poetry.
It is written in rhyming or leonine hexameters, and is remarkable for
its quaint play on names, conceived and executed in a truly medieval
taste.</p>

<p>The following displays an almost classical intensity of voluptuous
passion, and belongs in all probability to a period later than the
<i>Carmina Burana</i>. I have ventured, in translating it, to borrow the
structure of a song which occurs in Fletcher's <i>Rollo</i> (act v. scene
2), the first stanza of which is also found in Shakespeare's <i>Measure
for Measure</i> (act iv. scene 1), and to insert one or two phrases from
Fletcher's version. Whether the composer of that song had ever met
with the Latin lyric to Lydia can scarcely form the subject of
critical conjecture. Yet there is a faint evanescent resemblance
between the two poems.</p>

<p>remains in the original. This I did because it seemed necessary to
effect the transition from the stanzas beginning <i>Pande, puella,
pande</i>, to those beginning <i>Conde papillas, conde</i>.</p>

<p>Among these more direct outpourings of personal passion, place may be
found for a delicate little <i>Poem of Privacy</i>, which forms part of the
<i>Carmina Burana</i>. Unfortunately, the text of this slight piece is very
defective in the MS., and has had to be conjecturally restored in
several places.</p>

<p>Nor can I here forbear from inserting another <i>Poem of Privacy</i>,
bolder in its openness of speech, more glowing in its warmth of
colouring. If excuse should be pleaded or the translation and
reproduction of this distinctly Pagan ditty, it must be found in the
singularity of its motive, which is as unmedieval as could be desired
by the bitterest detractor of medieval sentiment. We seem, while
reading it, to have before our eyes the Venetian picture of a Venus,
while the almost prosaic particularity of description illustrates what
I have said above about the detailed realism of the Goliardic style.</p>

<p>The poem, <i>Ludo cum Caecilia</i>, which comes next in order, is one of
the most perfect specimens of Goliardic writing. To render its fluent,
languid, and yet airy grace, in any language but the Latin, is, I
think, impossible. Who could have imagined that the subtlety, the
refinement, almost the perversity of feeling expressed in it, should
have been proper to a student of the twelfth century? The poem is
spoiled toward its close by astrological and grammatical conceits; and
the text is corrupt. That part I have omitted, together with some
stanzas which offend a modern taste.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the following poem a lover bids adieu for ever to an unworthy
woman, who has betrayed him. This is a remarkable specimen of the
songs written for a complicated melody. The first eight lines seem set
to one tune; in the next four that tune is slightly accelerated, and a
double rhyme is substituted for a single one in the tenth and twelfth
verses. The five concluding lines go to a different kind of melody,
and express in each stanza a changed mood of feeling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>I have tried in this instance to adopt the plaster-cast method of
translation, as described above,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and have even endeavoured to
obtain the dragging effect of the first eight lines of each strophe,
which are composed neither of exact accentual dactyls nor yet of exact
accentual anapaests, but offer a good example of that laxity of rhythm
permitted in this prosody for music.</p>

<p>Comparison with the original will show that I was not copying Byron's
<i>When we Two Parted</i>; yet the resemblance between that song and the
tone which my translation has naturally assumed from the Latin, is
certainly noticeable. That Byron could have seen the piece before he
wrote his own lines in question is almost impossible, for this portion
of the <i>Carmina Burana</i> had not, so far as I am aware, been edited
before the year 1847. The coincidence of metrical form, so far as it
extends, only establishes the spontaneity of emotion which, in the
case of the medieval and the modern poet, found a similar rhythm for
the utterance of similar feeling.</p>

reconciliation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> One part of its expostulation with the faithless

<p>A separate section should be assigned to poems of exile. They are not
very numerous, but are interesting in connection with the wandering
life of their vagrant authors. The first has all the dreamy pathos
felt by a young German leaving his beloved home in some valley of the
Suabian or Thuringian hills.</p>

<p>The second was probably intended to be sung at a drinking-party by a
student taking leave of his companions. It is love that forces him to
quit their society and to break with his studies. The long rhyming
lines, followed by a sharp drop at the close of each stanza upon a
short disjointed phrase, seem to indicate discouragement and
melancholy.</p>

<p>The third introduces us to a little episode of medieval private life
which must have been frequent enough. It consists of a debate between
a father and his son upon the question whether the young man should
enter into a monastic brotherhood. The youth is lying on a sickbed,
and thinks that he is already at the point of death. It will be
noticed that he is only diverted from his project by the mention of a
student friend (indicated, as usual, by an N), whom he would never be
able to see again if he assumed the cowl. I suspect, however, that the
poem has not been transmitted to us entire.</p>

<h2>XIX.</h2>


<p>The order adopted in this essay brings us now to drinking-songs. Next
to spring and love, our students set their affections principally on
the tavern and the winebowl. In the poems on the Order we have seen
how large a space in their vagrant lives was occupied by the tavern
and its jovial company of topers and gamesters. It was there that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some are gaming, some are drinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some are living without thinking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of those who make the racket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some are stripped of coat and jacket;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some get clothes of finer feather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some are cleaned out altogether;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one there dreads death's invasion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all drink in emulation."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song from which I have extracted this stanza contains a parody of
S. Thomas Aquinas' hymn on the Eucharist.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> To translate it seemed
to me impossible; but I will cite the following stanza, which may be
compared with stanzas ix. and x. of <i>Lauda Sion</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bibit hera, bibit herus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bibit miles, bibit clerus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bibit ille, bibit illa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bibit servus cum ancilla,<br /></span>

<p><i>In Dulci Jubilo</i> yields an example of mixed Latin and German. This is
the case too with a comparatively ancient drinking-song quoted by
Geiger in his <i>Renaissance und Humanismus</i>, p. 414. It may be

mentioned that the word <i>Bursae</i>, for <i>Burschen</i>, occurs in stanza v.
This word, to indicate a student, can also be found in <i>Carm. Bur.</i>,
p. 236, where we are introduced to scholars drinking yellow Rhine wine
out of glasses of a pale pink colour&mdash;already in the twelfth century!</p>

<p>Two lyrics of distinguished excellence, which still hold their place
in the <i>Commersbuch</i>, cannot claim certain antiquity in their present
form. They are not included in the <i>Carmina Burana</i>; yet their style
is so characteristic of the Archipoeta, that I believe we may credit
him with at least a share in their composition. The first starts with
an allusion to the Horatian <i>tempus edax rerum</i>.</p>

<p>Among drinking-songs of the best period in this literature may be
reckoned two disputations between water and wine. In the one, Thetis
defends herself against Lyaeus, and the poet assists in vision at
their contest. The scene is appropriately laid in the third sphere,
the pleasant heaven of Venus. The other, which on the whole appears to
me preferable, and which I have therefore chosen for translation,
begins and ends with the sound axiom that water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> and wine ought never
to be mixed. It is manifest that the poet reserves the honour of the
day for wine, though his arguments are fair to both sides. The final
point, which breaks the case of water down and determines her utter
confusion, is curious, since it shows that people in the Middle Ages
were fully alive to the perils of sewage-contaminated wells.</p>

<p>The same precept, "Keep wine and water apart," is conveyed at the
close of a lyric distinguished in other respects for the brutal
passion of its drunken fervour. I have not succeeded in catching the
rollicking swing of the original verse; and I may observe that the
last two stanzas seem to form a separate song, although their metre is
the same as that of the first four.</p>

<p>Closely allied to drinking-songs are some comic ditties which may have
been sung at wine-parties. Of these I have thought it worth while to
present a few specimens, though their medieval bluntness of humour
does not render them particularly entertaining to a modern reader.</p>

<p>The first I have chosen is <i>The Lament of the Roast Swan</i>. It must be
remembered that this bird was esteemed a delicacy in the Middle Ages,
and also that pepper was highly prized for its rarity. This gives a
certain point to the allusion in the third stanza.</p>

<p>As a third specimen I select a little bit of mixed prose and verse
from the <i>Carmina Burana</i>, which is curious from its allusion to the
Land of Cockaigne. Goliardic literature, it may be parenthetically
observed, has some strong pieces of prose comedy and satire. Of these,
the <i>Mass of Topers</i> and <i>Mass of Gamesters</i>, the <i>Gospel according to
Marks</i>, and the description of a fat monk's daily life deserve
quotation.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> They are for the most part, however, too profane to
bear translation.</p>

<h2>XXI.</h2>


<p>The transition from these trivial and slightly interesting comic songs
to poems of a serious import, which played so important a part in
Goliardic literature, must of necessity be abrupt. It forms no part of
my present purpose to exhibit the Wandering Students in their capacity
as satirists. That belongs more properly to a study of the earlier
Reformation than to such an inquiry as I have undertaken in this
treatise. Satires, especially medieval satires, are apt, besides, to
lose their force and value in translation. I have therefore confined
myself to five specimens, more or less closely connected with the
subjects handled in this study.</p>

<p>The first has the interest of containing some ideas which Villon
preserved in his ballad of the men of old time.</p>

(where it occurs) that I have thought it well to quote its grimly
medieval condemnation of human life.</p>

<p>The fourth, in like manner, would have but little to do with a
Commersbuch, were it not for the fact that the most widely famous
modern student-song of Germany has borrowed two passages from its
serious and tragic rhythm. Close inspection of <i>Gaudeamus Igitur</i>
shows that the metrical structure of that song is based on the
principle of quoting one of its long lines and rhyming to it.</p>

<p>Having alluded to <i>Gaudeamus Igitur</i>, I shall close my translations
with a version of it into English. The dependence of this lyric upon
the rhythm and substance of the poem on <i>Contempt for the World</i>,
which I have already indicated, is perhaps the reason why it is sung
by German students after the funeral of a comrade. The Office for the
Dead sounding in their ears, occasions the startling <i>igitur</i> with
which it opens; and their mind reverts to solemn phrases in the midst
of masculine determination to enjoy the present while it is yet
theirs.</p>

<h2>XXII.</h2>


<p>I have now fulfilled the purpose which I had in view when I began this
study of the <i>Carmina Vagorum</i>, and have reproduced in English verse
what seemed to me the most characteristic specimens of that
literature, in so far as it may be considered precursory of the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>In spite of novelty, in spite of historical interest, in spite of a
certain literary charm, it is not an edifying product of medieval art
with which I have been dealing. When I look back upon my own work, and
formulate the impression left upon my mind by familiarity with the
songs I have translated, the doubt occurs whether some apology be not
required for having dragged these forth from antiquarian obscurity.</p>

<p>The truth is that there is very little that is elevated in the lyrics
of the Goliardi. They are almost wholly destitute of domestic piety,
of patriotism, of virtuous impulse, of heroic resolve. The greatness
of an epoch which throbbed with the enthusiasms of the Crusades, which
gave birth to a Francis and a Dominic, which witnessed the manly
resistance offered by the Lombard burghs to the Teutonic Emperor, the
formation of Northern France into a solid monarchy, and the victorious
struggle of the Papacy against the Empire, finds but rare expression
in this poetry. From the <i>Carmina Burana</i> we cull one chant indeed on
Saladin, one spirited lament for Richard Coeur de Lion; but their
general tone is egotistic.</p>

<p>Even the satires, so remarkable for boldness, are directed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> against
those ecclesiastical abuses which touched the interests of the clerkly
classes&mdash;against simony, avarice, venality in the Roman Curia, against
the ambition of prelates and the effort to make princely benefices
hereditary, rather than against the real sins of the Church&mdash;her
wilful solidification of popular superstitions for the purposes of
self-aggrandisement, her cruel persecution of free thought, and her
deflection from the spirit of her Founder.</p>

<p>With regard to women, abundant examples have been adduced to
illustrate the sensual and unromantic spirit of these lettered lovers.
A note of undisguised materialism sounds throughout the large majority
of their erotic songs. Tenderness of feeling is rarely present. The
passion is one-sided, recognised as ephemeral, without a vista on the
sanctities of life in common with the beloved object. Notable
exceptions to the general rule are the lyrics I have printed above on
pp. 75-78. But it would have been easier to confirm the impression of
licentiousness than to multiply specimens of delicate sentiment, had I
chosen to ransack the whole stores of the <i>Carmina Burana</i>.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to censure their lack of so-called chivalrous
woman-worship. That artificial mood of emotion, though glorified by
the literary art of greatest poets, has something pitiably unreal,
incurably morbid, in its mysticism. But, putting this aside, we are
still bound to notice the absence of that far more human self-devotion
of man to woman which forms a con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>spicuous element in the Arthurian
romances. The love of Tristram for Iseult, of Lancelot for Guinevere,
of Beaumains for his lady, is alien to the Goliardic conception of
intersexual relations. Nowhere do we find a trace of Arthur's vow
imposed upon his knights: "never to do outrage,... and alway to do
ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen succour upon pain of death." This
manly respect for women, which was, if not precisely the purest, yet
certainly the most fruitful social impulse of the Middle Ages,
receives no expression in the <i>Carmina Vagorum</i>.</p>

<p>The reason is not far to seek. The Clerici were a class debarred from
domesticity, devoted in theory to celibacy, in practice incapable of
marriage. They were not so much unsocial or anti-social as
extra-social; and while they gave a loose rein to their appetites,
they respected none of those ties, anticipated none of those home
pleasures, which consecrate the animal desires in everyday existence
as we know it. One of their most popular poems is a brutal monastic
diatribe on matrimony, fouler in its stupid abuse of women, more
unmanly in its sordid imputations, than any satire which emanated from
the corruption of Imperial Rome.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The cynicism of this exhortation
against marriage forms a proper supplement to the other kind of
cynicism which emerges in the lyrics of triumphant seducers and light
lovers.</p>

<p>But why then have I taken the trouble to translate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>these songs, and
to present them in such profusion to a modern audience? It is because,
after making all allowances for their want of great or noble feeling,
due to the peculiar medium from which they sprang, they are in many
ways realistically beautiful and in a strict sense true to vulgar
human nature. They are the spontaneous expression of careless, wanton,
unreflective youth. And all this they were, too, in an age which we
are apt to regard as incapable of these very qualities.</p>

<p>The defects I have been at pains to indicate render the Goliardic
poems remarkable as documents for the right understanding of the
brilliant Renaissance epoch which was destined to close the Middle
Ages. To the best of them we may with certainty assign the
seventy-five years between 1150 and 1225. In that period, so fruitful
of great efforts and of great results in the fields of politics and
thought and literature, efforts and results foredoomed to partial
frustration and to perverse misapplication&mdash;in that potent space of
time, so varied in its intellectual and social manifestations, so
pregnant with good and evil, so rapid in mutations, so indeterminate
between advance and retrogression&mdash;this Goliardic poetry stands
alone. It occupies a position of unique and isolated, if limited,
interest; because it was no outcome of feudalism or ecclesiasticism;
because it has no tincture of chivalrous or mystic piety; because it
implies no metaphysical determination; because it is pagan in the
sense of being natural; because it is devoid of allegory, and,
finally, because it is emphatically humanistic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>In these respects it detaches itself from the artistic and literary
phenomena of the century which gave it birth. In these respects it
anticipates the real eventual Renaissance.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, points of contact between the Students' Songs and
other products of the Middle Ages. Scholastic quibblings upon words;
reiterated commonplaces about spring; the brutal contempt for
villeins; the frequent employment of hymn-rhythms and preoccupation
with liturgical phrases&mdash;these show that the Wandering Scholars were
creatures of their age. But the qualities which this lyrical
literature shares with that of the court, the temple, or the schools
are mainly superficial; whereas the vital inspiration, the specific
flavour, which render it noteworthy, are distinct and self-evolved. It
is a premature, an unconscious effort made by a limited class to
achieve <i>per saltum</i> what was slowly and laboriously wrought out by
whole nations in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Too
precocious, too complete within too narrow limits, it was doomed to
sterility. Not the least singular fact about it is that though the
<i>Carmina Vagorum</i> continued to be appreciated, they were neither
imitated nor developed to any definite extent after the period which I
have indicated. They fell still-born upon the unreceptive soil of
European culture at that epoch. Yet they foreshadowed the mental and
moral attitude which Europe was destined to assume when Italy through
humanism gave its tone to the Renaissance.</p>

<p>The Renaissance, in Italy as elsewhere, had far more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> serious aims and
enthusiasms in the direction of science, refined self-culture,
discoveries, analysis of man and nature, than have always been
ascribed to it. The men of that epoch did more hard work for the
world, conferred more sterling benefits on their posterity, than those
who study it chiefly from the point of view of art are ready to admit.
But the mental atmosphere in which those heroes lived and wrought was
one of carelessness with regard to moral duties and religious
aspirations, of exuberant delight in pleasure as an object of
existence. The glorification of the body and the senses, the
repudiation of an ascetic tyranny which had long in theory imposed
impossible abstentions on the carnal man, was a marked feature in
their conception of the world; and connected with this was a return in
no merely superficial spirit to the antique paganism of Greece and
Rome.</p>

<p>These characteristics of the Renaissance we find already outlined with
surprising definiteness, and at the same time with an almost childlike
na&iuml;vet&eacute;, a careless, mirth-provoking nonchalance, in the <i>Carmina
Vagorum</i>. They remind us of the Italian lyrics which Lorenzo de'
Medici and Poliziano wrote for the Florentine populace; and though in
form and artistic intention they differ from the Latin verse of that
period, their view of life is not dissimilar to that of a Pontano or a
Beccadelli.</p>

<p>Some folk may regard the things I have presented to their view as ugly
or insignificant, because they lack the higher qualities of sentiment;
others may over-value them for precisely the same reason. They seem to
me note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>worthy as the first unmistakable sign of a change in modern
Europe which was inevitable and predestined, as the first literary
effort to restore the moral attitude of antiquity which had been
displaced by medieval Christianity. I also feel the special relation
which they bear to English poetry of the Etizabethan age&mdash;a relation
that has facilitated their conversion into our language.</p>

<p>That Wandering Students of the twelfth century should have transcended
the limitations of their age; that they should have absorbed so many
elements of life into their scheme of natural enjoyment as the artists
and scholars of the fifteenth; that they should have theorised their
appetites and impulses with Valla, have produced masterpieces of
poetry to rival Ariosto's, or criticisms of society in the style of
Rabelais, was not to be expected. What their lyrics prove by
anticipation is the sincerity of the so-called paganism of the
Renaissance. When we read them, we perceive that that quality was
substantially independent of the classical revival; though the
influences of antique literature were eagerly seized upon as useful
means for strengthening and giving tone to an already potent revolt of
nature against hypocritical and palsy-stricken forms of spiritual
despotism.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>NOTE ON THE "ORDO VAGORUM" AND THE "ARCHIPOETA."</h3>
<p><i><b>See Section vii. pp. <a href="#Page_16">16-23</a>, above.</b></i></p>


<p>It seems desirable that I should enlarge upon some topics which I
treated somewhat summarily in Section vii. I assumed that the
Wandering Scholars regarded themselves as a kind of Guild or Order;
and for this assumption the Songs Nos. 1, 2, 3, translated in Section
xiii. are a sufficient warrant. Yet the case might be considerably
strengthened. In the <i>Sequentia falsi evangelii secundum marcam
argenti</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> we read of the <i>Gens Lusorum</i> or Tribe of Gamesters,
which corresponds to the <i>Secta Decii</i>,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> the <i>Ordo Vagorum</i>, and
the <i>Familia Goliae</i>. Again, in Wright's <i>Walter Mapes</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> there is
an epistle written from England by one Richardus Goliardus to <i>Omnibus
in Gallia Goliae discipulis</i>, introducing a friend, asking for
information <i>ordo vester qualis est</i>, and giving for the reason of
this request <i>ne magis in ordine indiscrete vivam</i>. He addresses his
French comrades as <i>pueri Goliae</i>, and winds up with good wishes for
the <i>socios sanctae confratriae</i>. Proofs might be multiplied <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>that the
Wandering Students in Germany also regarded themselves as a
confraternity, with special rules and ordinances. Of this, the curious
parody of an episcopal letter, issued in 1209 by <i>Surianus, Praesul et
Archiprimas</i>, to the <i>vagi clerici</i> of Austria, Styria, Bavaria, and
Moravia is a notable example.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>I have treated Golias as the eponymous hero of this tribe, the chief
of this confraternity. But it ought to be said that the name Golias
occurs principally in English MSS., where the Goliardic poems are
ascribed to <i>Golias Episcopus.</i> Elsewhere the same personage is spoken
of as <i>Primas</i>, which is a title of dignity applying to a prelate with
jurisdiction superior even to that of an archbishop. Grimm<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> quotes
this phrase from a German chronicle: <i>Primas vagus multos versus
edidit magistrates</i>. In the <i>Sequentia falsi evangelii</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> we find
twice repeated <i>Primas autem qui dicitur vilissimus</i>. The Venetian
codex from which Grimm drew some of his texts<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> attributes the
<i>Dispute of Thetis and Lyaeus</i> and the <i>Advice against Matrimony</i>,
both of which passed in England under the name of Golias and
afterwards of Walter Map, to <i>Primas Presbyter</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to this Primas, it is important to mention that Fra
Salimbene in his Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> gives a succinct account of him under
the date 1233. It runs as follows: <i>Fuit his temporibus Primas
canonicus eoloniensis, magnus trutannus et magnus trufator, et maximus
versificator et velox, qui, si dedisset cor suum ad diligendum Deum,
magnus in litteratura divina fuisset, et utilis valde</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span><i>Ecclesiae
Dei. Cujus Apocalypsim, quam fecerat, vidi, et alia scripta plura</i>.
After this passage follow some anecdotes, with quotations of verses
extemporised by Primas, and lastly the whole of the Confession,
translated by me at p. 55 above. Thus Salimbene, who was almost a
contemporary author, attributes to Primas two of the most important
poems which passed in England under the name of Golias, while the
Venetian MS. ascribes two others of the same class to Primas
Presbyter. It is also very noteworthy that Salimbene expressly calls
this Primas a Canon of Cologne.</p>

<p>That this poet, whoever he was, had attained to celebrity in Italy (as
well as in Germany) under the title of Primas, appears also from the
following passage of a treatise by Thomas of Capua<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> on the Art of
Writing: <i>Dictaminum vero tria sunt genera auctoribus diffinita,
prosaicum scilicet, metricum et rithmicum; prosaicum ut Cassiodori,
metricum ut Virgilii, rithmicum ut Primatis</i>. Boccaccio was in all
probability referring to the same Primas in the tale he told about
<i>Primasso</i>,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> who is described as a man of European reputation, and
a great and rapid versifier. It is curious that just as Giraldus seems
to have accepted <i>Golias</i> as the real name of this poet,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> so Fra
Salimbene, Thomas of Capua, and Boccaccio appear to use <i>Primas</i> as a
Christian name.</p>

<p>The matter becomes still more complicated when we find, as we do, some
of the same poems attributed in France to Walter of Lille, in England
to Walter Map, and further current under yet another title of dignity,
that of <i>Archipoeta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>We can hardly avoid the conclusion that by Golias Episcopus, Primas,
and Archipoeta one and the same person, occupying a prominent post in
the Order, was denoted. He was the head of the Goliardic family, the
Primate of the Wandering Students' Order, the Archpoet of these
lettered minstrels. The rare excellence of the compositions ascribed
to him caused them to be spread abroad, multiplied, and imitated in
such fashion that it is now impossible to feel any certainty about the
personality which underlay these titles.</p>

<p>Though we seem frequently upon the point of touching the real man, he
constantly eludes our grasp. Who he was, whether he was one or many,
remains a mystery. Whether the poems which bear one or other of his
changing titles were really the work of a single writer, is also a
matter for fruitless conjecture. We may take it for granted that he
was not Walter Map; for Map was not a Canon of Cologne, not a follower
of Reinald von Dassel, not a mark for the severe scorn of Giraldus.
Similar reasoning renders it more than improbable that the Golias of
Giraldus, the Primas of Salimbene, and the petitioner to Reinald
should have been Walter of Lille.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>At the same time it is singular that the name of Walter should twice
occur in Goliardic poems of a good period. One of these is the famous
and beautiful lament:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Versa est in luctum&mdash;eithara Waltheri."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This exists in the MS. of the <i>Carmina Burana</i>, but not in the Paris
MS. of Walter's poems edited by M&uuml;ldner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>It contains allusions to the poet's ejection from his place in the
Church&mdash;a misfortune which actually befell Walter of Lille. Grimm has
printed another poem, <i>Saepe de miseria,</i> in which the name of Walter
occurs.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It is introduced thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hoc Gualtherus sub-prior<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Jubet in decretis."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Are we to infer from the designation <i>Sub-prior</i> that the Walter of
this poem held a post in the Order inferior to that of the Primas?</p>

<p>It is of importance in this connection to bear in mind that five of
the poems attributed in English MSS. to Golias and Walter Map, namely,
<i>Missus sum in vineam</i>, <i>Multiformis hominum</i>, <i>Fallax est et
mobilis</i>, <i>A tauro torrida</i>, <i>Heliconis rivulo</i>, <i>Tanto viro
locuturi</i>, among which is the famous Apocalypse ascribed by Salimbene
to Primas, are given to Walter of Lille in the Paris MS. edited by
M&uuml;ldner.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> They are distinguished by a marked unity of style; and
what is also significant, a lyric in this Paris MS., <i>Dum Gualterus
aegrotaret</i>, introduces the poet's name in the same way as the <i>Versa
est in luctum</i> of the <i>Carmina Burana</i>. Therefore, without identifying
Walter of Lille with the Primas, Archipoeta, and Golias, we must allow
that his place in Goliardic literature is very considerable. But I am
inclined to think that the weight of evidence favours chiefly the
ascription of serious and satiric pieces to his pen. It is probable
that the Archipoeta, the follower of Reinald von Dassel, the man who
composed the most vigorous <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>Goliardic poem we possess, and gave the
impulse of his genius to that style of writing, was not the Walter of
the <i>Versa est in luctum</i> or of <i>Dum Gualterus aegrotaret</i>. That
Walter must have been somewhat his junior; and it is not unreasonable
to assume that he was Walter of Lille, who may perhaps be further
identified with the <i>Gualtherus sub-prior</i> of the poem on the author's
poverty. This Walter's Latin designation, <i>Gualtherus de Insula</i>,
helps, as I have observed above,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to explain the attribution of the
Goliardic poems in general to Walter Map by English scribes of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>After all, it is safer to indulge in no constructive speculations
where the matter of inquiry is both vague and meagre. One thing
appears tolerably manifest; that many hands of very various dexterity
contributed to form the whole body of songs which we call Goliardic.
It is also clear that the Clerici Vagi considered themselves a
confraternity, and that they burlesqued the institutions of a
religious order, pretending to honour and obey a primate or bishop, to
whom the nickname of Golias was given at the period in which they
flourished most. Viewed in his literary capacity, this chief was
further designated as the Archpoet. Of his personality we know as
little as we do of that of Homer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<h2>TABLE OF SONGS TRANSLATED IN THIS VOLUME.</h2>


<p>N.B.&mdash;In order to facilitate the comparison between my translations
and the originals, I have made the following table. The first column
gives the number of the song and the second the page in this book; the
third column gives the beginning of each song in English; the fourth
gives the beginning of each song in Latin. The references in the fifth
column are to the little anthology called <i>Gaudeamus</i> (Leipzig,
Teubner, 1879); those in the sixth column are to the printed edition
of the Benedictbeuern Codex, which goes by the title of <i>Carmina
Burana</i> (Stuttgart, auf Kosten das Literarischen Vereins, Hering &amp; Co.
printers, 1847).</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
